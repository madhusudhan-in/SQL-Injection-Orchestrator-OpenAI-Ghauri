## **SQL Injection Orchestrator**

This project includes an advanced SQL injection orchestration system that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate intelligent, context-aware payloads and coordinate comprehensive security testing across multiple endpoints.

### **orchestrator.py**

The `orchestrator.py` file is a sophisticated automation tool that combines LLM-powered payload generation with the Ghauri SQL injection framework. It provides:

- **Intelligent Payload Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze endpoint responses and generate context-aware SQL injection payloads that can bypass common WAFs
- **Parallel Scanning**: Implements multi-threaded scanning across multiple endpoints for efficient testing
- **Log Correlation**: Correlates scan results with WAF and database audit logs for comprehensive security analysis
- **Automated Testing**: Streamlines the entire SQL injection testing workflow from endpoint discovery to vulnerability confirmation

#### **Key Features:**
- **LLM Integration**: Leverages GPT-4 for smart payload generation based on endpoint context
- **Multi-threaded Execution**: Scans up to 5 endpoints simultaneously for optimal performance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Integrates with WAF and database logs for complete attack surface visibility
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and timeout management for production environments

#### **Configuration:**
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."  # Set your OpenAI API key
ENDPOINTS_FILE = "endpoints.yaml"  # List of endpoints to scan
WAF_LOG = "waf.log"        # WAF log file path
DB_LOG = "db_audit.log"    # Database audit log path
```

#### **Usage:**
```bash
python3 orchestrator.py
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Load endpoints from `endpoints.yaml`
2. Probe each endpoint to establish baseline responses
3. Generate intelligent payloads using GPT-4
4. Execute Ghauri scans with generated payloads
5. Correlate results with security logs
6. Provide comprehensive vulnerability assessment

### **endpoints.yaml**

The `endpoints.yaml` file defines the target endpoints for SQL injection testing. Each endpoint entry includes:

- **url**: The target endpoint URL
- **params**: Query parameters or POST data to test
- **method**: HTTP method (GET/POST)

#### **Example Configuration:**
```yaml
- url: "https://api.example.com/user"
  params: "id=1"
  method: "GET"
- url: "https://api.example.com/login"
  params: "username=admin&password=pass"
  method: "POST"
- url: "https://api.example.com/search"
  params: "q=test"
  method: "GET"
```

#### **Supported HTTP Methods:**
- **GET**: For endpoints that accept query parameters
- **POST**: For endpoints that accept form data or JSON payloads

### **Integration with Ghauri**

The orchestrator seamlessly integrates with the Ghauri framework by:
- Automatically invoking Ghauri with generated payloads
- Processing Ghauri output for vulnerability confirmation
- Coordinating multiple scan sessions across different endpoints
- Providing unified reporting and log correlation

### **Security Considerations**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool is designed for authorized security testing only. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing any endpoints.

- Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Respect rate limits and avoid overwhelming target systems
- Monitor and log all testing activities for audit purposes
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities discovered

### **Dependencies**

The orchestrator requires the following Python packages:
- `requests`: HTTP client for endpoint probing
- `openai`: OpenAI API client for GPT-4 integration
- `pyyaml`: YAML file parsing
- `pandas`: Log analysis and correlation
- `concurrent.futures`: Multi-threaded execution

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Advanced Usage**

For custom payload generation, modify the `get_smart_payload()` function to include:
- Custom prompt engineering for specific application types
- Industry-specific security testing patterns
- Compliance requirements (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
- Custom bypass techniques for specialized WAFs

The orchestrator can be extended to support:
- Additional LLM providers (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Custom payload templates
- Integration with other security tools
- Automated reporting and alerting
- Compliance reporting and documentation
